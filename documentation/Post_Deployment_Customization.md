# Post-Deployment Customization Guide

## Making Changes After Deployment

The Jewelry Inventory System is fully customizable even after deployment. Since you'll have complete access to the source code and database, you can make various modifications to meet your evolving business needs.

## Types of Customizations Available

### User Interface Customizations
- Change color schemes and branding elements
- Modify dashboard layouts
- Customize report formats
- Add new visualizations or charts
- Redesign any screen or form

### Functional Enhancements
- Add new modules or features
- Modify existing business logic
- Create custom workflows
- Add new report types
- Integrate with other business systems

### Data Model Extensions
- Add new fields to existing data models
- Create new data entities
- Modify validation rules
- Add new relationships between data

## How to Make Changes

### For Simple Changes
1. Access the source code repository
2. Make the desired changes to frontend files (React components)
3. Test in a development environment
4. Deploy the updated version

### For Database Schema Changes
1. Create proper database migration scripts
2. Test migrations in a development environment
3. Apply migrations to production with proper backup
4. Update corresponding backend and frontend code

### For Major Functional Changes
1. Create a development branch in the source repository
2. Implement and test new features
3. Perform user acceptance testing
4. Deploy the new version with proper release management

## Support for Customizations

After deployment, you have several options for making changes:

1. **Self-Implementation**: Since you have complete access to the source code and documentation, your technical team can implement changes directly.

2. **Technical Support**: Our team can provide guidance and technical support for your developers as they implement changes.

3. **Professional Services**: We can implement the changes for you based on your requirements, with costs determined by the scope of work.

## Best Practices for Customization

1. **Always work in a development environment** first before applying changes to production.

2. **Create proper database backups** before making any schema changes.

3. **Follow the existing code architecture** to maintain consistency and stability.

4. **Document all changes** made to the system for future reference.

5. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production, especially for changes that affect critical business processes.

## Training for Customization

We offer additional technical training for your development team covering:
- System architecture
- Code organization
- Database schema design
- Best practices for extending the system
- Testing and deployment procedures

This training can be scheduled at your convenience after the initial deployment.
